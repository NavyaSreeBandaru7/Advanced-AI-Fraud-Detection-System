📈 Advanced Techniques Explained
🧠 Generative AI Data Augmentation
python# Creates intelligent synthetic fraud samples
synthetic_fraud = create_synthetic_fraud_data(
    original_data=fraud_transactions,
    num_synthetic=500,
    correlation_aware=True
)
Innovation: Uses correlation-aware noise injection to generate realistic fraud patterns while preserving statistical properties.
🔤 NLP-Inspired Transaction Embeddings
python# Treats transactions like sentences
embeddings = create_transaction_embeddings(
    transactions=data,
    embedding_dim=8,
    vocab_size=25
)
Innovation: Novel cross-domain application of NLP techniques to financial data, creating dense vector representations of transaction patterns.
🤖 Autoencoder Anomaly Detection
python# Learns normal transaction patterns
autoencoder_features = create_autoencoder_features(
    normal_transactions=train_data,
    encoding_dim=5
)
Innovation: Unsupervised learning approach that identifies fraudulent transactions by their inability to be reconstructed by patterns learned from normal transactions.
